## About Me
Hello! My name's Dennis and I'm a second-year undergraduate student at **UC San Diego** majoring in **Computer Science** and minoring in **Mathematics**. Through CSE 110, I'm working towards becoming a better software engineer. 

I think that this quote from W. Edwards Deming is something that every software engineer should live by:
> It is not enough to do your best: you must KNOW what to do, and THEN do your best.

Here's [a really cool picture](images/rick-roll.jpeg) I found randomly!

This quarter, I'm taking five classes. Here's a ranking of how excited I am for each of them, from most to least:
1. CSE 110
2. CSE 151A
3. CSE 101
4. CSE 199
5. MMW 15

## My Goals
I hope to go from only knowing how to `print("Hello World!")` to being able to create complex software projects that can be used and enjoyed by other people!

Be sure to check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/denniskluc) to see all the projects that I've worked on in the past!

Here's a list of things that I want to do in order to become a better software engineer:
- Try my best in CSE 110 and learn as much as I can.
- Do a great job during my internship this upcoming summer.
- Work on more personal projects.
- Learn more languages and technologies.
- Have fun!
